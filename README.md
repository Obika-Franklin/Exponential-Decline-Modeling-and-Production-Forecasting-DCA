# Exponential Decline Modeling and Production Forecasting (DCA)

![flat-statistics-presentation-with-arrow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ea707fb-3ceb-4ab1-b397-f639c300015b)

In this project, I performed a Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) on historical production data from an onshore field to predict future production rates and estimate the field's economic lifespan. This empirical method is one of the most widely used techniques in petroleum engineering for estimating recoverable reserves. The goal was to provide a critical forecast of the field's remaining economic life and total recoverable reserves, which is essential for guiding investment and production planning.

I wrote an article to document the analysis. You can check it out [here](https://reservoir-diaries.hashnode.dev/decline-curve-analysis-dca-with-excel-exponential-decline).
